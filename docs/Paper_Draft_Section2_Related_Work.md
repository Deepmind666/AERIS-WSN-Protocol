## 2.1 Classical Clustering Protocols
Early clustering schemes such as LEACH, PEGASIS, and HEED laid the foundation for energy-aware WSN routing, yet they relied on simplifying assumptions about propagation and MAC contention \cite{Heinzelman2005Energy,Lindsey2003PEGASIS,Younis2004HEED,Akyildiz2002A}. LEACH popularised probabilistic cluster-head rotation but ignored coupled interference and correlated losses \cite{Heinzelman2002An}, while PEGASIS reduced hop counts at the cost of serialized forwarding latency \cite{Lindsey2003PEGASIS}. HEED introduced residual-energy- and degree-aware elections, but like most 2000s-era protocols it still abstracted away queueing and channel variability. Comprehensive surveys show that even enriched variants (TL-HEED, TLEACH, SEP) inherit these limitations despite incremental heuristics \cite{AlKaraki2004Routing,Abbasi2007A,Sarkar2017Cluster}. Event-driven protocols such as Directed Diffusion and TEEN further illustrate the tension between responsiveness and radio realism when thresholding decisions are tuned offline \cite{Intanagonwiwat2000Directed,Manjeshwar2005TEEN}.

## 2.2 Cross-Layer and Environment-Aware Approaches
Cross-layer designs integrate RSSI, LQI, or congestion feedback to mitigate fading, but many still depend on instantaneous measurements without modelling humidity- or temperature-driven trends \cite{Wang2016An,Ayaz2011A}. Environment-aware clustering partitions the field or augments transmission power using environmental cues, yet often relies on static lookup tables or empirical tuning, leaving correlated interference untreated \cite{Kao2017A,Han2017Probabilistic,Han2018A}. Recent rechargeable WSN studies demonstrate the need for joint charging and sensing optimisation, but still assume deterministic link availability and perfect sensing \cite{Tariq2024A,Han2019District}. Underwater and mission-critical deployments highlight how mobility and acoustic attenuation reshape optimal coordination, motivating hybrid schemes with directional chargers, AUV relays, or path-priority routing \cite{Tang2025Enhancing,Ogundile2025Path}. Coverage-centric work on probabilistic node placement and NLOS-aware localisation likewise reinforces the importance of uncertainty margins and geometry-aware skeletons \cite{Jia2024Wireless,Qin2024Enhancing}. Despite these advances, few solutions simultaneously maintain fairness, reliability, and replicable statistics under real trace replay.

## 2.3 Learning-Based Routing and Control
Machine learning, especially reinforcement learning, has been adopted to predict link quality or automate cluster selection. Early work such as QELAR applied Q-learning to underwater networks but incurred heavy convergence time and storage footprints \cite{TiansiHu2010QELAR}. Multi-modal value-of-information planning and sparse inversion localisation further expose the computational burden of global optimisation in dynamic media \cite{Gjanci2018Path,Qi2025Sparse}. Recent metaheuristic or deep models (e.g., adaptive opposition-based clustering and hybrid secure routing for IoT-enabled WSNs) improve energy balance but require iterative training phases and powerful controllers incompatible with 8--32 KB motes \cite{Reddy2025Enhanced,Jain2025Optimized}. Consequently, many studies still evaluate on synthetic or small-scale testbeds, leaving open questions about reproducibility on public traces and about how to couple learning outputs with MAC- and radio-level safeguards.

## 2.4 Statistical Reliability and Fairness Enhancements
Reliability-centric work introduces redundant uplinks, queue-aware scheduling, or mobile sinks to extend lifetime, yet often reports mean values without effect sizes or multi-run statistics \cite{Wang2019Energy,Singh2025Enhanced}. Clustering algorithms that inject trust or density-aware costs demonstrate measurable gains but still rely on hand-crafted scoring rules and lack longitudinal fairness guarantees \cite{Yuan2014Data,Bhukya2025Hybrid}. Rechargeable and hybrid energy-transfer studies reveal how uneven charging can undermine resilience even when average energy is sufficient \cite{Tariq2024A}. These observations underscore the need for protocols that monitor fairness explicitly while linking reliability triggers to statistically significant degradations.

## 2.5 Positioning of AERIS
AERIS advances prior art through three dimensions:
- **Realistic stack integration**: environment-calibrated energy models, log-normal shadowing, and topology localisation derived from Intel Lab replays replace idealised assumptions \cite{Ayaz2011A,Jia2024Wireless,Qin2024Enhancing}.
- **Lightweight coordination**: skeleton backbones, CAS intra-cluster switching, gateway relays, and safety/fairness modules cooperate without invoking high-cost learning loops, enabling deterministic, interpretable control \cite{Han2017Probabilistic,Han2018A}.
- **Reproducible validation**: experiments span public Intel traces and synthetic topologies with unified end-to-end PDR definitions, multi-run statistics, effect sizes, and Holm-Bonferroni corrections \cite{Han2019District,Tariq2024A}.

By bridging realistic channel modelling, lightweight coordination, and rigorous evaluation, AERIS fills the gap between traditional heuristic clustering and computationally heavy learning-based methods, providing a path toward deployable, verifiable WSN routing.
