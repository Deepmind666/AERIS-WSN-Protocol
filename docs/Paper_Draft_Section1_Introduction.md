# Section 1. Introduction

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly embedded in industrial monitoring, smart buildings, and environmental observatories where deployment lifetimes extend over months while radio conditions shift hourly. Despite decades of research, mainstream routing evaluations still rely on idealized propagation or minimal MAC emulation, obscuring hidden terminals, backoff collisions, and bursty interference commonly seen in IEEE 802.15.4 deployments. Once lab protocols are exposed to humidity fluctuations, temperature-driven noise drift, or indoor human mobility, performance often degrades rapidly.

Real deployments further expose the energy–reliability dilemma. Protocols that prioritize aggressive retransmissions attain high packet delivery ratios (PDR) at the expense of battery life, while energy-lean clustering schemes collapse when links deteriorate. Emerging machine-learning or reinforcement-learning approaches promise adaptivity but demand training pipelines, memory, and convergence time incompatible with 8–32 KB motes. Engineers still hand-tune parameters in practice, lacking an end-to-end path that couples environment awareness, realistic channels, and routing decisions.

This work introduces the AERIS（环境自适应骨架路由） protocol, engineered to close the simulation-to-reality gap without resorting to heavyweight learning stacks. AERIS integrates (i) a realistic energy model calibrated on CC2420-class radios with temperature/humidity sensitivity, (ii) a log-normal shadowing channel aligned with Intel Lab geometry, and (iii) a lightweight coordination layer comprising skeleton backbones, gateway relays, and environment-adaptive switching (CAS). Together, these components sustain reliability under adverse propagation while preserving energy efficiency; safety fallback and fairness guard against overuse of cluster heads and trigger redundancy only under real failures.

We validate AERIS through Intel Berkeley Research Lab replays (2.22M records) and synthetic topologies spanning corridor and uniform deployments. Compared with classical baselines (LEACH, HEED, PEGASIS, TEEN) under a unified end-to-end metric, AERIS elevates end-to-end PDR by up to 30 percentage points, reduces total energy consumption by 7.9% on average versus PEGASIS, and maintains 100% node survival through the first 500 rounds. Ablations peel off CAS, gateway coordination, fairness, and safety modules. Statistical analysis uses two-sided Welch’s t-tests with Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals; the number of independent repetitions n follows figure legends (default n∈[30,200]). All code, data-processing scripts, and plotting utilities are open-sourced for full reproducibility.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews clustered routing, cross-layer optimization, environment adaptivity, and learning-based approaches; Section 3 formalizes the system model, energy/channel expressions, and objectives; Section 4 details AERIS architecture and coordination; Section 5 presents Intel replays and synthetic-topology setups; Section 6 reports results, ablations, sensitivity, and deployment considerations; Section 7 concludes with limitations and future work (including security extensions and edge-assisted intelligence).

## Contributions
This paper makes the following contributions:
- Protocol design: We present AERIS, a lightweight, environment-adaptive clustered routing framework that couples fuzzy-logic cluster-head selection with PSO-assisted multi-hop backbone formation and a cross-layer coordinator (Sec. 4).
- Environment-aware optimization: We formulate a temperature/humidity/interference-aware next-hop cost and a scheduler that adapts backbone, relay, and contention parameters with bounded complexity (Sec. 4).
- Reproducible and realistic evaluation: We build a replay-driven pipeline on the Intel Berkeley Research Lab dataset (2.22M samples) with calibrated energy and channel models, releasing code and scripts for end-to-end reproducibility (Sec. 5).
- Consistent performance gains: Across 30–200 independent runs per setting, AERIS reduces total energy consumption by 7.9% on average versus PEGASIS while keeping or improving PDR; maintains 100% node survival during the first 500 rounds in representative topologies; and achieves up to 30 percentage-point PDR improvements under harsh propagation, with statistically significant differences (two-sided Welch’s t-tests with Holm–Bonferroni correction) (Sec. 6).
- Practicality: AERIS operates within mote-class constraints (8–32 KB RAM), requires no offline training, and incorporates safety fallbacks and fairness to prevent cluster-head overuse (Sec. 4, Sec. 6).
- Open science: We provide data-processing and plotting utilities along with configuration files to facilitate verification and reuse (Sec. 5, Sec. 6).
